🛒 Supermarket Sales Analysis
This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project where I explored supermarket sales data using Excel, SQL, and Python. The goal was to uncover useful insights—like which products sell the most, how customers prefer to pay, and what patterns emerge across different branches and days.

📁 Project Overview
Here’s how I organized the project:

1.data/ – Contains the raw dataset (supermarket_sales.csv)

2.notebooks/ – Python scripts and notebooks for cleaning and analysis

3.excel_dashboard/ – Pivot tables and charts built in Excel

4.README.md – Documentation and summary of the project

🧰 Tools & Skills I Used
1.Excel for cleaning data and building dashboards

2.SQLite & SQL for querying and exploring the dataset

3.Python (with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for deeper analysis and visualizations

4.GitHub to manage the project and share it publicly

🔍 What I Discovered
1.The Food & Beverages category had the highest total sales

2.Cash was the most commonly used payment method

3.Saturday turned out to be the busiest day for transactions

4.The Giza branch had the highest overall revenue

 I built a simple but effective dashboard using Excel pivot tables and charts to visualize product performance, payment breakdowns, and daily trends.

🎓 What I Learned
1.How to clean and transform messy data using Excel

2.Writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights

3.Creating visualizations in Python to support data storytelling

4.Structuring and publishing a project on GitHub for my portfolio

This was a great hands-on experience that helped me connect the dots between tools and build something I can proudly showcase. Looking forward to diving into more complex datasets next!
